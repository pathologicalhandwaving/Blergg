## Misadventures in Emacs (again)

I love vim and my terminal. I really do so how could I even think of using emacs. Reasons against:
1. Emacs has a gui and I try to avoid guis like the plague
2. Emacs is written in lisp. Lisp has a syntax which makes the OCD side of me scream "no wrong!" due to its odd use of parentheses.

I tried out emacs before on my mac using aquamacs. Which I hated for the following reasons:
1. In addition to having simply having gui, the aquamacs gui was beyond ugly
2. The "menu system".
3. Non-modal configuration files (two functions)


I should mention in here I have ADD (not ADHD) not the ADD in which you beg you psychiatrist to diagnose, the kind where your psychiatrist after trying everything else they think of reluctantly tests you for and informs you of when the test results come back.

Why is knowing about my ADD important context? For the past three plus years I have been writing scripts, downloading packages, and crossing my fingers in the hopes of creating a complete immersive working environment. And when I say complete, I mean absolutely complete.


### Requirements for my setup
